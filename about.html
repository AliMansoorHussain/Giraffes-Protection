            <h1>Our organization</h1>
            <br>
            <p>This organization started out as a tour in Africa to raise awareness about the endangerment of giraffes,
                but as their numbers started declining, we began
                fertilizing the ground around their habitats, planting more trees, and filtering the dirty water for
                them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>What can you do?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>With every $5 donated, 3 trees are planted. It's time for you to make a difference! </p>

            <h2>How many giraffes have we helped?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>over the last 43 years, we have helped over 67 thousand giraffes. <br>
                from healthier food, to clear water, to even a new home!
            </p>

            <h2>Where is out Head Quarters?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Our H.Q is in Saar, Bahrain.</p>
             <br>
             <br>
             <h2>What next?</h2>
             <br>
             <p>Since we mainly operate in Africa, we come across a lot of endangered animals. <br>
                like Zebras, Elephants, and Rhinos. While we mostly stay focused on giraffes, <br>
                we are planning to expand our operations and start helping other animals too.
